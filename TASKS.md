# MVP Deployment Tasks

The Smart Host repository contains a lightweight FastAPI application with in-memory repositories and a minimal test suite. To prepare the project for its first deployment the following tasks should be addressed.

## Packaging and Dependencies
- [ ] Define project dependencies (e.g. `fastapi`, `uvicorn`) in `pyproject.toml` or a `requirements.txt` file.
- [ ] Provide a lock file or pinned versions to ensure reproducible installs.

## Application Configuration
- [ ] Add configuration handling (environment variables or config file) for runtime settings such as database URL and port.
- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` and container entry point for running the API with Uvicorn.

## Persistence Layer
- [ ] Replace the in-memory repositories with a persistent store (SQLite is sufficient for MVP).
- [ ] Implement database migrations or initialization scripts.

## API Improvements
- [ ] Validate booking input (check-out must occur after check-in, etc.).
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages when invalid data is submitted.
- [ ] Document the API using OpenAPI docs generated by FastAPI.

## Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests covering service logic for properties, rooms and bookings.
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints using `fastapi.testclient`.

## Documentation
- [ ] Expand `README.md` with instructions for local development, running tests and deploying the Docker container.
- [ ] Provide example commands or a shell script under `scripts/` to populate sample data in the persistent store.
